# Large Project Coordinator Skill

A skill for orchestrating large software projects (bots, GitHub-based development, new OpenClaw skills) with multi‑agent role assignment, token‑minimization prompts, structured planning, and coordinator status reporting.

## Highlights
- Strict workflow: **discussion → plan → detailed implementation**
- Model/role selection with user confirmation
- GitHub‑first artifacts (plans/notes/reports)
- Quality gates + tests + Docker (when possible)
- Coordinator status format with optional agent/token stats

## Structure

- `references/` — detailed docs and templates

## Quick usage
