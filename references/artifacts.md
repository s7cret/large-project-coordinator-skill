# GitHub Artifacts & Structure

## Recommended repo layout
- `plans/` — project plans, roadmaps
- `notes/` — decisions, meeting notes
- `patches/` — patch notes, diffs, hotfix logs
- `reports/` — status reports, summaries
- `docs/` — user/dev documentation
- `tests/` — test plans, fixtures
- `docker/` — Dockerfile, compose, deployment notes

## Naming
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md` for plans/notes/reports.
- Keep files short; link to issues/PRs.
